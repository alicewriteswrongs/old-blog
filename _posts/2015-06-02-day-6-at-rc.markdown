Today I successfully finished the first Matasano challenge! Yes! It
requires you to build a hex -> base64 translator, which works
successfully! I didn't yet implement what to do if there aren't enough
bytes for base64 (e.g. if the last set of three bytes is only two) but
that's ok!

I also attended the cryptography workshop that Frank hosted today, which
was really great. I think I'm going to start doing a coursera course on
cryptography.

Also, I bought a fender for my bike! Dry(ish) ride home!
