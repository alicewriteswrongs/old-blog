It's day 16 already? Yikes! Time has really been flying by here. It's easy
to sort of let it slide by, and feel like I haven't been doing too much,
but when I look back at my blog posts I realize that I've done quite a bit
of stuff since I got here!

Today I read some more of the Rust book, and got through the first two
example programs. They are fairly simple things, but throw in some wacky
Rust stuff that I don't understand yet. I'm liking it so far!

I also read some K&R, did some of the Stanford cryptography course, and
worked on Eudyptula task 04. Good stuff!
