I had a great second day at RC! I'm just going to give a quick summary of what I did:

- I did an intro to Haskell workshop, which inspired me to pick up [Real
  World Haskell](http://book.realworldhaskell.org/) again. Luckily,
  there's a paper copy here! Apparently when I was doing it before I read
  up to the end of chapter 3. Nice!
- I started working on a Git commit tree visualizer. Basically I did some
  planning and thinking, and I wrote a couple of useful functions to
  interact with a Git repo. Fun!
- I also read some more of K&R, and solved some exercises for that book.

All in all, a pretty good day! I had to leave a little early to go look at
an apartment, so I didn't get as much done as I would have liked.
