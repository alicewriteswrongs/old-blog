I've been trying to find a way to teach myself data structures (gotta
learn those CS fundamentals for some reason) that was fun and engaging.
I like reading books for some stuff, but for some reason when I try to
read about them my eyes just glaze over and I space completely out.

So, I decided to think a bit about how I usually learn best. It's actually
by writing about things - writing a short guide to a piece of software, or
an explanation for some strange (unexpected) behavior I've encountered
really helps solidify my mental model for how that thing works. I decided
to disregard learning data structures from any particular source or book
and just implement them myself! 

I've pretty much finished with my [linked
list](https://github.com/aliceriot/linkedlist) implementation. In addition
to just writing the code I wrote a little essay about what I learned as
I went, and the design choices I made. I'm also currently working on
a [hash table](https://github.com/aliceriot/hashtable), which has also
been fun.

Anyway, the moral of the story is to think about how you learn best, and
then do that! Don't spend hours watching Coursera videos or poking through
some tome if it doesn't work for you.
