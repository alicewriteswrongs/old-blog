I'm super super excited because tomorrow I'm going to start my batch at
the [Recurse Center](https://www.recurse.com)! My bus got in today around
noon, and after many difficulties with the subway (and all the stuff I was
toting) I checked in to my airbnb place around 3pm.

All I've done so far is take a quick bike ride around (Prospect Park is
gorgeous!) and get some groceries. Tomorrow morning I'll ride across the
bridge into Manhattan for the first time!

I'm putting this up online because hopefully it will make me more
accountable: I'm going to try to post every day after finishing up at RC,
as a recap of what I worked on and got done that day. Hopefully this will
be a motivational exercise! We'll see if I stick with it.

Yay!
