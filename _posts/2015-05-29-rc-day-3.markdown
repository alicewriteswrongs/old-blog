What did I do today? Mainly I worked on the gitViz project I've started.
I have several of the functions I need for it to function working. I'm
understanding more and more why people don't use C for string processing!

I also made some progress on the CryptoPals stuff, read some more K&R, and
finished chapter 3 in Real World Haskell.
