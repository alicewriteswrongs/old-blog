I passed Eudyptula task 02! Nice! So now I have to compile a custom kernel
that has '-eudyptula' in the version string. I compiled the kernel with
this option, and I made a patch (following the mailing list conventions)
and sent it off! We'll see when I get it back if that was good.

Frank also ran another workshop today, which was about finding exploits in
unsafe C code. Buffer overflows and the like! Fun stuff. So I worked on
a couple of those problems today, and then also started working on the 2nd
Matasano challenge (which has us implement 'fixed xor'). I ended up
finishing the XOR problem, because I could reuse a good deal of the code
from the first challenge. Nice!

Tomorrow I hope to do the next matasano problem, work on solving some of
the exploits from today, and (hopefully!) do the next eudyptula challenge.
