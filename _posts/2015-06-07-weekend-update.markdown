I forgot to post on Friday! Yeesh! Too busy enjoying the MoMA. It's free
on Friday evenings, which is great because I resent paying to look at
things. I got to see a couple of really cool things, including a couple of
Malevich pieces and a lot of really lovely photography. Also, free!

Beside art, on Friday I started the Coursera cryptography course (from
Stanford), basically just by watching the first two intro videos. I hope
to get more of that done in the coming week.

I also worked a lot on the third Matasano problem, which I was not able to
get working on Friday. BUT! I did get it working today! So I can now break
a super simple random 8 bit cypher pretty reliably. I think my solution
doesn't perform perfectly on the test hex string because the message is so
short, I want to do some experiments tomorrow to see if it performs better
with more information.

Yesterday I also explored Central Park a bit, which is really lovely. NYC
has such nice green space!
