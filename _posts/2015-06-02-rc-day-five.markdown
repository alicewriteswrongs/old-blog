Late post! 

On Monday I passed the first Eudyptula challenge, and got the email for
the 2nd one, which involves compiling and booting (in a VM or not) the
Linux kernel, from the current source. It compiled pretty easily because
I used the

    make localmodconfig

option, which gives you the configuration that was used to compile the
kernel that is currently running on your system. I found the [Arch wiki
article](https://wiki.archlinux.org/index.php/Kernels/Compilation/Traditional)
helpful, and in the end I'm not sure why I previously viewed compiling
a kernel as something serious!

Frank Wang, the current resident at RC, also ran a really cool workshop
yesterday, where we implemented a password manager in Javascript. I had
fun filling in all the functions necessary to make that work.

I also went to the Monday night talk (delicious food!) and got rained on
a lot :/

Oh yeah, I also moved from the airbnb I was staying in to a real
apartment! It's a bit closer to RC as well (Crown Heights vs. Kensington).
I'm also figuring out better bike routes to take through Brooklyn, I've
determined that Eastern Parkway -> Vanderbilt avenue is a lot better than
the route I was taking from Kensington.
