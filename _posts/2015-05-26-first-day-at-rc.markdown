Today was my first day at the Recurse Center! What did I get up to? Well:

- I wrote a kernel module (hello.c) which prints 'Hello World!' to
  KERN_DEBUG (you can read it with dmesg). I did this for the first
  exercise in the [Eudyptula Challenge](http://eudyptula-challenge.org/).
  I've been having trouble getting the automated scripts to accept my
  Makefile though, it compiles fine (I can load the module on my laptop
  and it works as expected) but I'm not hitting whatever the script is
  looking for. I'm going to poke at this more tomorrow.
- I started the [Matasano Cryptography Challenge](http://cryptopals.com/)!
  This is sort of a similar thing to the above (I like solving
  problemsets, I guess?) but focused on cryptography. I started working on
  the first problem, which is to convert hex to Base64. Fun! I'm going to
  be working in C for this.
- I played Catan! I'm not very good at Catan.

It was a great first day! I rode in from Brooklyn in the morning, and
although I crossed the wrong bridge (I meant to do the Brooklyn and
somehow wound up crossing the Manhattan, even with a smartphone) it went
very smoothly. I think NY is actually a better place to ride a bike than
Boston.

Looking forward to tomorrow!
