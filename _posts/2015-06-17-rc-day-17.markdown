This is a bit late! oops.

Yesterday (day 17) I read a bunch of the rust book, did a few exercises
from K&R, and worked on the fourth Matasano problem. Specifically,
I decided to reimplement the solution I was working on in Python, so I can
test out different approaches a little bit more quickly. We'll see how
that goes!

Plans for today include more Rust, more work on the above-mentioned Python
stuff, and some videos from the cryptography course.
