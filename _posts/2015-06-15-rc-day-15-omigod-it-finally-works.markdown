So in my first week here at RC I started a small utility to print out the
commit history for a git repository. I wanted to write this in C, for some
practice using C for a real project, which was maybe a bad choice - I'm
pretty sure writing the same program in Python would have been about
1/10th of the time. Ah well!

Anyway, I finished this project today! It works, look:

Which is super exciting! The hardest part of this project was probably
just figuring out how to print it out - I got some great help from Tom (RC
facilitator) which set me on the right track. I think it's been good for
my programming self-confidence to carry a small project like this all the
way through, and to keep going on it even when reaching difficult parts. 

I learned a bit more about C, especially about types and structs, and also
about building a slightly larger project than I had previously. I tore
apart and reorganized several times during the project, and spent a little
more time ensuring things were organized in a sensible way (which
definitely made things easier to debug!). Nice!

I also decided to start learning about Rust today, so I've been reading
through the (very lovely) [Rust
book](http://doc.rust-lang.org/stable/book/). I have another project I'm
thinking of starting either this week or next week, and I was planning to
try to learn C++, but I might try Rust instead! We'll see.
