I made a zine! It teaches the reader how to install Thunderbird and
Enigmail, and how to use them to send encrypted emails.

I learned a fair amount in the process, mainly about how frustrating
graphics programs and printing can be. Turns out laser printers can't
address the outer 1/4 inch or so of the page, which is kind of a bummer if
you designed your zine to print to the edges...ah well.

Anyway, if you'd like to download a copy or fiddle with any of the
intermediate files I put everything on Github
[here](https://github.com/aliceriot/PocketGuide).
