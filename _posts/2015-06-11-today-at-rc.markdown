Today was great! I got a lot of the functionality in my git printing tool
done, I have now successfully implemented both a hash table and an n-ary
tree for this project! Basically all I have left to do is implement
something to print out the tree, so I just need to think carefully about
how to deal with commits with multiple children or parents.

The downside to that was that I didn't get too much else done yet today.
I'm stil at RC now, and I think I may try to watch some videos for the
crypto course I started before heading home.
