I've been in New York now for about a week, and I've been taking a bunch
of pictures to send over TextSecure to folks in Boston. Here are some
highlights:

###Bloomberg Tower

I went to a talk about GnuPG last night that was in the Bloomberg Tower.
I thought it was a bit strange to hold an event about a piece of
technology that enables secure communication and privacy in a building which
requires a government issued photo ID to enter. They also take your photograph
at the desk and issue you a badge (which you have to wear at all times). No one
else seemed bothered by this? Maybe this is just how all big towers are here?
They did have lots of snacks.

Anyway, it's a tall building and we could see central park:

###Brooklyn Botanical Garden

Today I visited the Brooklyn Botanical Garden, which was a really awesome
place. Lots of really nice landscaping!

Gross water though! This was kind of a theme:

They have a nice bonsai room, including this beautiful dead one:

and this one planted in moss!

and this one growing over a rock:

Cool stuff!

Going along with the bonsai theme, they have a Japanese style garden, with
a Shinto gate, small shrine, and another gross looking pond (this one with
fish!):

Fish!

There are also indoor (greenhouse) gardens:

Great place overall! I had a lot of fun just walking around. Also on Saturdays
if you get there between 10 and noon it's free!

###Bridges!

I took some pictures of the bridges (I'm so ashamed of doing this in public,
I feel I've been forever marked a tourist)

That was about it! I've been really into exploring the city and getting
a better sense of how it fits together geographically (biking is great for
this!). Here's a bonus picture of my anxious puppy, whom I miss very much:

She's not in NYC! :(((
